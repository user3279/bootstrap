          <p class="card-text">The architecture of the Harrapans is seen to be ahead of its time.
            Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were well-planned grid towns with wide main roadways and smaller planes intersecting at right angles.

            During the Indus Valley Civilization, brick grid patterns, a well-defined city plan, immaculate drainage systems, lofty city walls, and multi-story dwellings were all common architectural elements.
            
            Every piece of the building served a definite purpose, and the city as a whole was more useful than attractive.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Structures, sculptures, and buildings that were carved out of a single solid natural rock, exactly where it stood, are known as rock-cut architecture.
            India is most recognized for its rock-cut architecture, which has over 1500 documented constructions of international significance. The Barabar Caves in Bihar, which were found in the 3rd century BC ( Mauryan Period), are the earliest of them.
            The Ellora Caves, the Ajanta Caves, and numerous of the Mahabalipuram sculptures are also world-famous rock-cut sculptures.
            In the post-Mauryan period, temple architecture also flourished in different parts of India.</p>

          <h2 class="card-title">Indo-Islamic Architecture (13th Century AD- 18th Century AD) </h2>
          <p class="card-text">India's architecture saw numerous alterations during the medieval period. Many architectural ideas and methods were merged into existing buildings with the entrance of Muslims in India, giving rise to Indo-Islamic architecture.
            Mughal architecture and Architecture of the Delhi Sultanate or Imperial Style are two distinct styles that merged Hindu and Islamic architecture.
            The Mughal architecture combines Central Asian, Islamic, Persian, Arabic, and Turkish architectural traditions in a unique way. Huge bulbous shaped domes, enormous halls, gigantic entrances, and elegant minarets distinguish it.
            The Imperial Style, on the other hand, is distinguished by its ornately carved arches and domes. Floral designs were popular, as were Hindu themes such as lotuses and swastikas contrasted with Quran passages.

          <h2 class="card-title">British Indo-Saracenic Architecture (18th Century AD Onwards)</h2>
          <p class="card-text">The British adopted Indo-Saracenic architecture in India in the second part of the nineteenth century.
            This architectural style can be seen in public and government buildings. It was inspired by Indo-Islamic architecture in India as well as worldwide influences such as gothic revival and neo-classical forms.

            Shift from Ancient to Modern Architecture
            Massive housing requirements have arisen as a result of the rising economy and population.
            Indian architecture has changed as a result of globalization and exposure to the outside world. Glass and designer shapes and designs now make up the majority of constructions.
            With each new project, architects and designers push the boundaries of style in an attempt to express their originality.
            The luxury home sector in India is now one of the fastest expanding divisions of the Indian economy. Luxury, on the other hand, is subjective.
            Luxury living is more about how well you use your space and the quality of design than it is about size or substance.</p>
