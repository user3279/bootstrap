          <p class="card-text">The tradition of Indian sculpture extends from the Indus valley civilization of 2500 to 1800 BCE, during which time small terra-cotta figurines were produced. The great circular stone pillars and carved lions of the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE) gave way to mature Indian figurative sculpture in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, in which Hindu and Buddhist themes were already well-established. A wide range of styles and traditions subsequently flourished in different parts of India over the succeeding centuries, but by the 9th–10th centuries CE Indian sculpture had reached a form that has lasted with little change up to the present day. This sculpture is distinguished not by a sense of plastic volume and fullness but rather by its linear character; the figure is conceived from the standpoint of its outline, and the figure itself is graceful, slender, and has supple limbs. From the 10th century this sculpture was used mainly as a part of architectural decoration, with vast numbers of relatively small figures of mediocre quality being produced for this purpose./p>

          <p class="card-text">Sānchi sculpture, early Indian sculpture that embellished the 1st-century-BC gateways of the Buddhist relic mound called the Great Stupa (stupa No. 1) at Sānchi, Madhya Pradesh, which is one of the most magnificent monuments of its time. The region of Sānchi, however, like the great centres at Sārnāth and Mathura, had a continuous artistic history from the 3rd century BC to the 11th century AD.


            Sānchi is the site of three stupas: stupa No. 1, an Aśokan foundation enlarged in succeeding centuries; No. 2, with railing decorations of the late Śuṅga period (c. 1st century BC); and No. 3, with its single toran (ceremonial gateway) of the late 1st century BC–1st century AD. Other features of interest include a commemorative pillar erected by the emperor Aśoka (c. 265–238 BC); an early Gupta temple (temple No. 17), early 5th century, with a flat roof and pillared portico; and monastic buildings ranging over several centuries.

          <p class="card-text">colossus, statue that is considerably larger than life-size. They are known from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China, and Japan. The Egyptian sphinx (c. 2550 BC) that survives at al-Jīzah, for example, is 240 feet (73 m) long; and the Daibutsu (Great Buddha; AD 1252) at Kamakura, Japan, is 37 feet (11.4 m) high.The ancient Greeks made a number of colossi that are presently known purely through historical texts and echoes in figurines and coins, such as the archaic Apollo of Delos and Phidias’ chryselephantine (gold and ivory) figure of Athena Parthenos. Chares’ statue of Helios in Rhodes was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. More than 100 feet (30 m) high, it took 12 years to complete. The Romans also erected large statues; Pliny reports, for example, that Zenodorus made a 106-foot (32-metre) colossus of Nero.

          <h2 class="card-title">Kouros</h2>
          <p class="card-text">kouros, plural kouroi, archaic Greek statue representing a young standing male. Although the influence of many nations can be discerned in particular elements of these figures, the first appearance of such monumental stone figures seems to coincide with the reopening of Greek trade with Egypt (c. 672 BC). The kouros remained a popular form of sculpture until about 460 BC.

            The large stone figures began to appear in Greece about 615–590 BC. While many aspects of the kouroi directly reflect Egyptian influence—especially the application in some kouroi of the contemporary Egyptian canon of proportions—they gradually took on distinctly Greek characteristics. Unlike the Egyptian sculptures, the kouroi had no explicit religious purpose, serving, for example, as tombstones and commemorative markers. They sometimes represented the god Apollo, but they also depicted local heroes, such as athletes.
            
            Another difference between the Egyptian and Greek figures is evident shortly after the first appearance of archaic Greek statues: the Egyptians had developed a formula for the human figure that—with rare exceptions—they followed strictly over a period of thousands of years; distinctions between individuals were indicated chiefly by facial features. The earliest kouroi closely followed the Egyptian geometric norm: the figures were cubic, starkly frontal, broad-shouldered, and narrow-waisted. The arms were held close to the sides, fists usually clenched, and both feet were firmly planted on the ground, knees rigid, with the left foot slightly advanced. As Greek understanding of human anatomy increased, the kouroi became increasingly naturalistic. By the end of the kouros period, the figures were no longer frontal, nor were the arms and legs rigid. Having mastered the anatomy of the human figure and the problem of balance, Greek sculptors turned their sights to gesture and the depiction of action. See also kore./p>

          <h2 class="card-title">South Indian bronze</h2>
          <p class="card-text">South Indian bronze, any of the cult images of Hindu divinities that rank among the finest achievements of Indian visual art. The images were produced in large number from the 8th to the 16th century, principally in the Thanjāvūr and Tiruchchirāppalli districts of modern Tamil Nadu, and maintained a high standard of excellence for almost 1,000 years.

            During the Pallava period, metal sculpture closely followed the canons of contemporary stone sculpture, and the images were almost invariably frontal, though modelled fully in the round, with arms held symmetrically to either side. A greater fluidity of movement is apparent in images of the early Cōla period (10th–11th century AD), and the movements and hand gestures of dance are frequently employed. The Cōla images are unsurpassed in their elegance, sensitive modelling, and balanced tension. During the Vijayanagar period (1336–1565) the ornamentation tended to become more elaborate, interfering with the smooth rhythm of the body, and the postures became more rigid.
            
            The icons range from small household images to almost life-size sculptures intended to be carried in temple processions. A few Buddhist and Jaina images were produced, but the figures mostly represent Hindu divinities, especially various iconographic forms of the god Śiva and Lord Vishnu, together with their consorts and attendants. Also of outstanding quality are the many images of Śiva and Vaiṣṇava saints (the Āḻvārs).
            
            
            The images are cast by the cire-perdue, or lost-wax, process (see lost-wax process). Final sculptural touches are added to the image after it is cast, with the result that the images are “carved” as well as “modelled.” Important collections of South Indian bronzes are housed in the Thanjāvūr Museum and Art Gallery, in Tamil Nadu, and at the Government Museum in Madras, but the largest number of fine images are in the various temples of southern India.</p>

          <h2 class="card-title">Relief</h2>
          <p class="card-text">relief, also called relievo, (from Italian relievare, “to raise”), in sculpture, any work in which the figures project from a supporting background, usually a plane surface. Reliefs are classified according to the height of the figures’ projection or detachment from the background. In a low relief, or bas-relief (basso-relievo), the design projects only slightly from the ground and there is little or no undercutting of outlines. In a high relief, or alto-relievo, the forms project at least half or more of their natural circumference from the background and may in parts be completely disengaged from the ground, thus approximating sculpture in the round. Middle relief, or mezzo-relievo, falls roughly between the high and low forms. A variation of relief carving, found almost exclusively in ancient Egyptian sculpture, is sunken relief (also called incised relief), in which the carving is sunk below the level of the surrounding surface and is contained within a sharply incised contour line that frames it with a powerful line of light and shade. Intaglio, likewise, is a sunken relief but is carved as a negative image like a mold instead of a positive (projecting) form.</p>
