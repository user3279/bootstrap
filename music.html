          <p class="card-text">The Carnatic branch composes music in the traditional octave.
            The music is kriti-based, with an emphasis on the saahitya or lyric quality of the musical piece.
            The Kriti is a highly developed musical song set to a specific raga and tala (rhythmic cycle).
            Every composition in the Carnatic style is made up of several parts: Pallavi, Anu Pallavi, Varnam and Ragamalika.

          <h2 class="card-title">Modern Music</h2>
          <p class="card-text">In music, modernism is defined by a desire for or belief in science, nature, intelligence, anti-romanticism, and other forward-thinking ideas.
            Modern music is also referred to as twentieth-century music. It has been a period of significant change.
            Science, technology, and our growing understanding of the world around us, for example, have inspired people to write music that reflects what they see and how they feel about what they see.
            Art experimented with new forms, techniques, and styles during the Modern period. Composers of music did the same thing.
            They experimented with various methods of producing sound. Rhythmic patterns became much more free, frequently changing throughout a piece.
            Melody's tone was becoming more dissonant, harsher, and was moving in leaps rather than steps. Harmony was becoming more dissonant as well.
            Different types of modern music includes - Jazz, Rock, Pop Music./p>
